Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming one of the most promising technologies, particularly with the introduction of generative AI chatbots. OpenAI launched its first AI chatbot in November 2022 and within a short couple of months, it has become the fastest-growing app in history. Who would have known that one of the most transformative technologies to be introduced in 2022 would be a simple text box to chat with a computer program that can give you an answer to almost any question that you ask it?
